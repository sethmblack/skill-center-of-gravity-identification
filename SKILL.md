# Center of Gravity Identification

**Expert Origin:** Carl von Clausewitz
**Skill Type:** Strategic Analysis Framework
**Trigger:** "What should we focus on?" / "We're spread too thin" / "Where is the decisive point?"

---

## Purpose

Identify the hub of all power and movement—the single point upon which everything depends—for both yourself and your opponent. Concentrate effort at this decisive point rather than dispersing across multiple targets.

---

## The Clausewitz Principle

*"One must keep the dominant characteristics of both belligerents in mind. Out of these characteristics a certain center of gravity develops, the hub of all power and movement, on which everything depends. That is the point against which all our energies should be directed."*

Disperse your efforts and you achieve nothing decisive, regardless of local victories. Concentrate against the center of gravity and the whole structure may collapse.

---

## What Is a Center of Gravity?

The center of gravity is the source of power, cohesion, and will. It is what holds everything together. Destroy or neutralize it, and resistance crumbles. Protect yours, and you maintain the ability to continue.

**It is NOT:**
- Simply the largest target
- The most visible element
- What you wish were the center of gravity
- What would be convenient to attack

**It IS:**
- The source of strength and cohesion
- What enables continued resistance
- What, if lost, causes systemic collapse
- Often protected, often not obvious

---

## Types of Centers of Gravity

### Military/Competitive
- The main force or capability
- Key supply lines or resources
- Critical infrastructure

### Political/Organizational
- Leadership will and cohesion
- Public/stakeholder support
- Alliances and partnerships

### Economic/Market
- Revenue source or key customer
- Core technology or capability
- Brand reputation or trust

### Psychological/Moral
- Belief in eventual victory
- Organizational culture
- Key relationships or loyalty

---

## Workflow
### Step 1: Identify Your Own Center of Gravity

**Question:** What is the source of your power and ability to continue?

| Candidate | Why It Matters | If Lost, Then... |
|-----------|----------------|------------------|
| [Element 1] | [Its role] | [Consequence] |
| [Element 2] | [Its role] | [Consequence] |
| [Element 3] | [Its role] | [Consequence] |

**Test:** Which loss would be most catastrophic? Which would cause systemic collapse rather than just setback?

### Step 2: Identify the Opponent's Center of Gravity

**Question:** What is the source of their power and ability to resist?

| Candidate | Why It Matters | If Neutralized, Then... |
|-----------|----------------|-------------------------|
| [Element 1] | [Its role] | [Consequence] |
| [Element 2] | [Its role] | [Consequence] |
| [Element 3] | [Its role] | [Consequence] |

**Test:** What do they protect most carefully? What, if struck, would cause their position to collapse?

### Step 3: Validate the Center of Gravity

Apply these tests:

| Test | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Essentiality** | Can they continue without it? |
| **Vulnerability** | Can it actually be reached/affected? |
| **Relevance** | Does neutralizing it achieve your objective? |
| **Cascading Effect** | Does striking it cause systemic collapse? |

A true center of gravity passes all four tests.

### Step 4: Assess Concentration Feasibility

**Question:** Can you concentrate sufficient force against the center of gravity?

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Resources available | |
| Access to the target | |
| Time required | |
| Risk of concentration | |
| Secondary effects | |

### Step 5: Strategic Recommendations

Based on analysis:

**If their CoG is vulnerable:**
- Concentrate maximum effort against it
- Accept risk elsewhere
- Move decisively

**If their CoG is protected:**
- Identify what protects it
- Determine if protection can be removed
- Consider whether a different approach is needed

**If your CoG is vulnerable:**
- Protect it above all else
- Consider whether to strengthen or diversify
- Beware of opponent recognizing it

## Output Format

### Center of Gravity Analysis

**Context:** [Situation description]

**Your Center of Gravity:**
- **Identified:** [What it is]
- **Why:** [Source of power/cohesion]
- **Vulnerability:** [How exposed]
- **Protection Required:** [What must be done]

**Opponent's Center of Gravity:**
- **Identified:** [What it is]
- **Why:** [Source of their power/resistance]
- **Vulnerability:** [How it can be reached]
- **Approach:** [How to concentrate against it]

**Validation:**
| Test | Your CoG | Their CoG |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Essential? | | |
| Vulnerable? | | |
| Relevant? | | |
| Cascading? | | |

**Strategic Recommendation:**
[Concentrate where? Protect what? Accept what risk?]

**Clausewitz Counsel:**
[Perspective on decisive action vs. dispersed effort]

## Example Application

**Context:** Startup competing against established market leader for enterprise customers.

**Your Center of Gravity:**
- **Identified:** Technical team and product innovation capability
- **Why:** Only advantage over well-resourced competitor; source of differentiation
- **Vulnerability:** Key engineers could be poached; burnout risk
- **Protection Required:** Retention focus; sustainable pace; equity alignment

**Opponent's Center of Gravity:**
- **Identified:** Existing customer relationships and switching costs
- **Why:** Customers don't leave because migration is painful, not because product is better
- **Vulnerability:** If migration is made painless, lock-in disappears
- **Approach:** Focus all product effort on migration tools and data portability

**Validation:**
| Test | Your CoG | Their CoG |
|------|----------|-----------|
| Essential? | Yes - without innovation, no differentiation | Yes - without lock-in, customers evaluate alternatives |
| Vulnerable? | Moderately - talent market is competitive | Yes - technically solvable |
| Relevant? | Yes - directly enables competition | Yes - directly enables customer acquisition |
| Cascading? | Yes - losing team ends competitive position | Partially - they have other advantages |

**Strategic Recommendation:**
Concentrate product development on migration/switching tools. Every feature that makes switching easier strikes their center of gravity. Accept that you cannot match their breadth; focus entirely on making switching painless. Simultaneously protect your team through retention investment.

**Clausewitz Counsel:**
*"You list many potential initiatives but have not identified the decisive point. Your competitor's power rests not on their product superiority—which is debatable—but on the pain of switching. Make switching painless and you have struck the hub of their defensive position. All other efforts are secondary."*

## Common Mistakes

1. **Confusing size with centrality** - The largest element is not necessarily the center of gravity
2. **Wishful identification** - Identifying what you can attack rather than what matters
3. **Static thinking** - Centers of gravity can shift as situations evolve
4. **Ignoring your own** - Focusing on offense while leaving your CoG exposed
5. **Dispersing anyway** - Identifying the CoG but still spreading effort across multiple fronts

---

## When to Use
- Strategic planning and resource allocation
- Competitive analysis
- Crisis response prioritization
- Organizational restructuring
- Any situation where effort is scattered without decisive effect

## Voice Note

When delivering center of gravity analysis, emphasize concentration and decisive action. Clausewitz opposed half-measures and dispersed effort. The counsel should drive toward focus, even when focus requires accepting risk elsewhere.
